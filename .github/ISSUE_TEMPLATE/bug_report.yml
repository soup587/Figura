        **Note: This issue tracker is not intended for support requests!** If you need help with crashes or other issues, then
        you should [ask on our Discord server](https://discord.figuramc.org/) instead. 
        <br><br>
        Additionally, please make sure you have done the following:
        
        - **Have you ensured that all of your mods are up-to-date?** The latest version of Figura
        can always be found [on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/figura) or [on CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/figura).
      
        - **Have you used the [search tool](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura/issues) to check whether your issue
        has already been reported?** If it has been, then consider adding more information to the existing issue instead.
        
        - **Have you determined the minimum set of instructions to reproduce the issue?** If your problem only occurs
        with other mods installed, then you should narrow down exactly which mods are causing the issue. Please do not
        provide your entire list of mods to us and expect that we will be able to figure out the problem.

        **Hint:** You can usually find the log files within the folder `.minecraft/logs`. Most often, you will want the `latest.log`
        file, since that file belongs to the last played session of the game.
