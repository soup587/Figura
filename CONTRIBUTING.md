# Contributing

When contributing to Figura, please first discuss and/or interact with our community via our [Discord](https://discord.figuramc.org/). 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development Process
Note - do not merge upstream into your pr branch if a clean rebase is possible.

1. Development happens on the default branch. ie; 1.20, etc
2. Ensure the feature has not been denied and is in demand via the `ðŸ“§ä¸¨mod-suggestions` channel in our [Discord](https://discord.figuramc.org/) or has the [Enhancement]([https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura/labels/enhancement](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement+)) tag in the Issues tab.
   
    OR:

   Ensure what you are doing is actually a bug via the `ðŸ‘¾ä¸¨bug-reports` channel in our [Discord](https://discord.figuramc.org/) or has the [Bug]([https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura/issues](https://github.com/FiguraMC/Figura/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+)) tag in the Issues tab.

3. Communicate with developers and other contributors about what you are building and adding. This helps keep multiple people from working on the same thing alone.

4. Clearly and extensively document everything you've added/changed in the pull request. This helps when compiling all the changes into full release patch notes and adding entries to the wiki.

5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request a developer to merge it for you.

## Translation Contribution Process 
1. You must be fluent and/or knowledgeable in the language you are translating to.

2. We use [Weblate](https://weblate.org) to manage our translations. Visit our instance [here](https://translate.figuramc.org/projects/figuramc/). This makes it much easier for other contributors to view the progress on a specific language.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team via a ticket in our [Discord](https://discord.figuramc.org/). All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
